DESCRIPTION:

Project: Weather Data Visualization using OpenWeatherMap API and Python
Objective:
The goal of this project is to fetch real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and visualize the information using Python. The project provides an intuitive way to display key weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed for a specified city. By leveraging Python libraries like requests, matplotlib, and seaborn, users can visualize the data in a clear, graphical format to make weather comparisons and analysis more accessible.

Project Components:
API Integration:

OpenWeatherMap API: The project fetches weather data using OpenWeatherMap's free API. The API provides data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather metrics for cities across the globe.
API Key: To interact with OpenWeatherMap, the project requires an API key which is generated upon registration on their platform.
Data Fetching:

requests Library: This Python library is used to send HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API, retrieve weather data in JSON format, and parse the response.
Location-based Query: The project allows users to specify a city for which they want to fetch the weather data. The city is passed as a query parameter in the API call.
Data Processing:

The response from OpenWeatherMap API is in JSON format. The program extracts key weather data (temperature, humidity, and wind speed) from this JSON object.
The data is parsed and organized into variables to be displayed and visualized.
Data Visualization:

matplotlib Library: This library is used to create the bar plot visualization. The plot displays weather metrics like temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
seaborn Library: Seaborn is used for styling the plot, making the visualization more aesthetically appealing with clean designs and color schemes.
User Interface:

The project is simple to use: the user needs to specify a city, and the program will fetch and display weather data for that location.
The visual output is a bar chart that clearly differentiates between the three weather metrics.
